my name is Kevin.Shen, my duke unqiue id is 1195512, my netid is ks713. I pledge that all the works in PC3 are done by myself.
For this PC3, I think it is easy to come up the solution, as suggested in regfile documents, I implemented a dffe module by myself, but similar to the templates provided in the base code, I initialize 32 32 bit registers, If the reset signal is 1, then we reset all registers to 32-bit 0, if the write signal is on, according to the control bits of writing, we determine the index of which register to write, otherwise, we need to read the corresponding registers according to the control index to determine which register to read. We use always blocks on the condition of posedge of clock or reset signal to make the operations do in many cycles. That is my implementation of PC3, I pledge that I done it by myself.
